CyphrIM is a distributed messaging web app. Built on top of GUN (https://gun.eco) which is an open source distributed graph database. All messages are encrypted and signed by key pairs chained after other messages. Synchronised directly peer-to-peer between browsers. Because of encryption and decentralisation, there is no server owning user data.
